### Food Fight






##Basic Game Play

The player enters food upc data to randomly generate a new character card.
The character’s generated stats are based on the nutritional information provided ie,
food with more protein will make a character with increased strength, more sugars
 might provide a faster battle rate, etc.

As well as a character card, the player might be presented with an option to
make up to 4 item cards by entering upc data. Much like the character creation
process, the item cards buffs/offensive abilities will be determined by the
nutritional data.

After the player has built their deck, they start off with a short story and begin
their “quest” by rolling. The outcome will determine how many spaces the character
moves on the gameboard, which is then followed by a chance enemy, npc, or treasure encounter.
The goal is to make it to the end of a game board without the character card being killed off.


##Enemy Battles
When a player encounters an enemy, a basic menu will be presented with
“Fight” and “Item”.

The `FIGHT` command will be a basic fight setup typical of RPGs however,
based on the data, each character will take a sort of elemental type based on
the data. It will probably be a “rock, paper, scissors” system where “rock” will
do more damage to “scissors”, and “scissors” will do more damage to “paper”, etc.


The `ITEM` command allows the player to use a buff or offensive item card.
